# Title: Preprocess and Cache Data
#
# This script reads in and pre-processes the DICES Dataset 
# (https://github.com/google-research-datasets/dices-dataset). Data is cached as
# 'df_v1v2v3.rds' (full data) and 'df_v1v2v3_harm' (expert-annotated data).
# Script can either be sourced or run interactively to view dataset diagnostics
# and visualizations.
